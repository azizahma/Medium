This is for monitoring corrections in writing projects published in LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/azizah-asi-69139676/) and Medium (https://medium.com/@azizahasi).

The first project was too long ago - so will be too late to archive here - Can Data Be Used as a Measure of Quality? - https://medium.com/@azizahasi/is-data-a-good-measure-for-quality-8ae64703e6f7

The second project - How Should We Explore ‘Uncertainty’?- https://medium.com/@azizahasi/how-should-we-explore-uncertainty-8907f3835ae3
